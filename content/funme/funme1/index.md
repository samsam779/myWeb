## 🎾 Tennis
I love watching tennis games — especially matches featuring **Hsieh Su-Wei**, the queen of tennis in Taiwan. Her creativity and humor on court always make the game more enjoyable.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Gym
I recently started going to the gym and hope to build up good physique soon! It’s still early, but I’m beginning to enjoy the routine and the feeling of small progress each time.

## 🎵 Music
I’m generally into **Pop** and **R&B**, though I’d say it depends on the vibe more than the genre itself.  
My favorite song recently is *“Tummy Hurts”* by **Reneé Rapp** — it’s been on repeat for days!
